Lender will consider releasing retainage for individual trades upon 100% completion of the work to be performed by such trade and receipt of final, valid lien waivers from the applicable contractor and subcontractors as determined by Lender.  Remaining retainage will be released upon delivery of a valid permanent certificate of occupancy (or reasonable equivalent) and Lender's determination that Completion of all Improvements has occurred.  </p>

                            <p>Eligible Project Costs that are Soft Costs will be advanced 100% against the presentation of receipts/invoices and cancelled checks up to the line item amount for such soft cost set forth in the Budget. Eligible Project Costs payable to affiliates of Borrower or Sponsor approved by Lender may not in any case exceed 4.0% of the total Eligible Project Costs unless approved by Lender in writing prior to Loan Closing.</p>
                            <p>The making of each Advance shall be conditioned upon, but not limited to:(a) the accuracy in all material respects of all representations and warranties in the Loan Documents; (b) there being no default or event of default in existence at the time of, or after giving effect to, the making of, such extension of credit; (c) receipt and approval by Lender and the Lender's Construction Consultant of a Draw Package; (d) endorsement(s) to the Lender's title policy as are necessary to insure the priority of such Advance; and (e) Lender's receipt and approval of additional documentation requested by Lender and customarily required by construction lenders for projects similar to the Project.</p>
