                        All expenses actually incurred by Lender in connection with the Loan will be paid by Sponsor and
                        Borrower regardless of whether the Loan closes for any reason whatsoever. These expenses shall include
                        but not be limited to Lender's due diligence including a Lender Underwriting Fee (which shall be
                        earned by Lender upon execution of this Loan Proposal and nonrefundable to Borrower), legal fees,
                        appraisal fee, environmental database searches, environmental site assessment and report(s), entity

                        other third-party expenses related to the Loan closing. Moreover, if prior to the Loan closing, Lender
                        determines that the Expense Deposit will be insufficient to pay all expenses, at Lender's request,
                        Sponsor shall promptly deliver to Lender funds in the amount of such shortfall. In the event that
                        the Loan closes, any unused portion of the Expense Deposit will be credited to Borrower at closing
                        or returned to Borrower if the Loan does not close.
